# Align-rgb-Channel
Python Code for correcting the misplaced channels of a image. It uses SSD and ZNCC algorithms to do so. An assignment project from the CSC320 (Visual Computing) course at the University of Toronto.

The program takes an image with its 3 channel separated and overlap them with the correct place, for some cases.
